# KMS-TPM
This project showcases how to generate and securely store RSA keys within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) using Rust and the tss-esapi crate. It provides a practical example of leveraging TPM's hardware-backed security for cryptographic key management.

# Key Features:
Generates RSA keys with customizable parameters (e.g., key size and hashing algorithm).

Stores keys securely within the TPM, ensuring protection against unauthorized access.

Demonstrates session management and key handling operations in a TPM environment.

# Technologies Used:
Rust programming language

tss-esapi crate for TPM interaction
